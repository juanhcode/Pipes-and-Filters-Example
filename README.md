# Pipes and Filters Architecture Example

## Overview
The Pipes and Filters architecture is a design pattern organizing a system into modular components. Data flows through interconnected "pipes" and is processed by "filters," promoting flexibility, maintainability, and easy system extension.
## Example Implementation
To illustrate the concept, let's consider a simple example where we have a pipeline that converts text to uppercase using a single filter:

1. **Pipe:** Manages the flow of data between filters.

2. **Uppercase Filter:** Processes the data by converting it to uppercase.
